# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Bionic Reader Website

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that lets a user input text and returns it in a way that's easier/ faster to read by bolding the first couple of letters.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

We are planning to use either pygame or javascript to make the function of the bionic reader. We'll use html/ css or a different web-design program to style the webpage. The software will have an input button where the user puts in text and an output where it'll print the text with the first couple of letters bolded in order for them to read faster. We also plan to allow a function where the user can upload files that they want to go through this reader. It'll return with the whole text in this form.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A functioning bionic reader tool that allows user input and the webpage is visually appealing.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A fully functioning bionic reader tool that allows user input, file uploads, and the webpage is pleasing to the eyes.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A fully functioning bionic reader tool that allows user input, file uploads, is more interactive, and the webpage is pleasing to the eyes.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I hope to learn more about webdesign through this project. I'm interested in learning more about how css/html/different webdesign program works. I will need to research how to set up a website and how to get everything running properly. I will have to also learn how these things work. I am planning to do the visual aspects and setting up the webpage while my partner is going to work on getting the bionic reader to work.
