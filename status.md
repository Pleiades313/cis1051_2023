Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

My partner (Macey Schriefer) and I got approval from Professor Rosen to change our original idea of making a bionic reader to making a website recommending food places in Philly.

We've made the front page of the website designed and added some functionality, such as clicking the name of the food place sends you to their website. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We have not added subpages to it yet.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

The only issues is figuring out how to get the placement of things right.
