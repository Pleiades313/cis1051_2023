(We're both freshman, I forgot to mention that in the video.)

My partner Macey Schriefer and I decided to make a website recommending food places in Philadelphia. We originally choose to make a bionic reader, but we decided to scrap that idea and make a website instead. We choose to do a minimal looking website with some basic functionalities. The major difficulties in making the website was figuring out how to structure things right and how to make the subpages work correctly. For example making each picture align correctly and having the text underneath it was little challenging to figure out. After we realize that we could use columns and rows, it made the process a lot easier. It was also a little challenging to figure out how to connect the sub pages to the main page. This project definitely taught us how to make a basic and working website. Learning how to use html was kinda fun, it was very satisfying when everything started coming together. Figuring out how to add different fonts/ color and buttons was cool.
